# Tiled2NES

This is a tool to help convert Tiled CSV format maps into C-compatible arrays for use with the excellent [nesdoug](https://github.com/nesdoug)'s 6502 assembly library to make NES games.

The program is written in Python using the PyQt5 library, making it compatible with Windows, OSX, and Linux.
